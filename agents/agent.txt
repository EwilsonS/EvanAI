- Evan's endorsements:
Thank you for coming up with so many solutions to share with the team on how to make our complicated set of components easier to work on. For example: Multiple times every day, I use the script you made for navigating from one repo to another. For another example: When I need conductor to run locally, it's only because YOU figured out all the moves and forced us all to try it. For another example: I have a local DB, because you figured out how and then pushed the rest of us to fall into line. Common work habits and the ability to run locally are both so essential for a team to be effective. You are very skilled at identifying a need, figuring out a solution, and guiding the rest of us to use that solution.
Evan has gone above and beyond with maintaining the Pr###io product ... Their efforts have allowed me to focus more attention to A&O's top priorities without sacrificing the value that we're delivering to Pr###io stakeholders and users.
A few examples of the leadership and awesome work they are providing:
leading the discussions with Vault team to onboard 3 new vault services. They've provided solutions with the end user in mind, recommended TFE implementation solutions, and handheld the Vault team with completing efforts beyond the scope of Pr###io onboarding.
Providing short term and long term solutions with implementation plans to new requests and issues that are encountered. They have offered solutions that are well thought out and account for future needs...
Balancing 2 large applications while staying present and knowledgeable in both. Evan is constantly striving to make the goal of automation happen across the board as well as pointing out opportunities for knowledge sharing and automation.
Evan has been a patient, encouraging, and friendly presence since day one, and it's been an absolute joy to work with him so far. He's always been more than willing to stop, explain the things I don't quite understand, and his flexible way of thinking makes him both receptive to the suggestions and feedback of others as well as a valuable source of insight. Without him, I don't think I would have been able to adapt to my new work environment as well as I feel I have.
Thanks for everything you do to make the ####### team a great team to be a part of. Whether it's frequent collaboration, always supporting your teammates through helpful feedback, or regularly bringing new ideas and being receptive to others' ideas, it all contributes to making a great team atmosphere.
Thank you for your constant availability and collaboration. I really appreciate the lessons and your input.
I love the way you respond to feedback! I learn so much about mental agility from you. Thank you!
